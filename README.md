âœ¨<b>Welcome!</b> âœ¨to this little corner in the vast void of the internet! I'm Jun Kow (IRL), a Mechatronics and Robotics engineer by qualification, but is more of a jack of traits despite having a PhD in Soft Robotics; and now as a QMS and Medical Device Auditor. You can check out my WebCV <a href="https://jiredo.github.io/jiredo">here!</a> 

This repository is both my personal space for tinkering and also a work environment. If you'd like to get in touch to discuss some matters, feel free to drop me an <a href=mailto:junwkow.com>ðŸ“« email.</a>
