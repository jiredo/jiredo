<b>Welcome!</b> to this little corner in the vast void of the internet! I'm Jun Kow (IRL), a Mechatronics and Robotics engineer by qualification, but is more of a jack of traits despite having a PhD in Soft Robotics; and now as a Medical device development engineer. You can check out my CV <a href="https://jiredo.github.io/jiredo">here!</a> 

This repository is both my personal space for tinkering and also a work environment.
